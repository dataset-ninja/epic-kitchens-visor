**EPIC-KITCHENS VISOR: VIdeo Segmentations and Object Relations** is a dataset for semantic segmentation, object detection, and identification tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. Also, it is used in the food industry. 

The dataset consists of 50729 images with 367002 labeled objects belonging to 305 different classes including *hand:right*, *hand:left*, *hob*, and other: *pan*, *sink*, *knife*, *board:chopping*, *tap*, *spoon*, *bowl*, *plate*, *water*, *cupboard*, *pot*, *lid*, *sponge*, *spatula*, *bag*, *fridge*, *package*, *drawer*, *fork*, *bottle*, *cup*, *onion*, *box*, *rack:drying*, *meat*, and 277 more.

Images in the VISOR dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 10125 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (32857 images), *test* (10125 images), and *val* (7747 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***subsequence***, ***kitchen***, ***action*** and ***video*** tags. Labels marked with its ***instance***, ***exhaustively annotated***, ***category*** and ***in contact*** tags. Explore it in Supervisely labeling tool.
